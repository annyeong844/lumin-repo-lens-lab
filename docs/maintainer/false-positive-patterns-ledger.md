# False Positive Patterns

Known detection failure modes. Consult before emitting findings. Update if a new pattern is discovered this session.

Format per entry: **Pattern** / **Symptom** / **Mitigation** / **Example**.

---

## FP-01 — Bundler-consumed config file default export

**Pattern:** Config files (`vite.config.*`, `rollup.config.*`, `webpack.config.*`, `next.config.*`, etc.) export a default consumed by the bundler, not imported by TypeScript code.

**Symptom:** `classify-dead-exports.mjs` flags the default as Category C (completely dead). Symbol graph finds no consumer.

**Mitigation:** Exclude `*.config.*` files from dead classification. If included, label as `[degraded, confidence: low, FP-01]`.

**Tool configs to always exclude:**
`vite.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `webpack.config.*`, `rollup.config.*`, `astro.config.*`, `next.config.*`, `playwright.config.*`, `jest.config.*`, `tsup.config.*`, `esbuild.config.*`

---

## FP-02 — `.d.ts` declared constants

**Pattern:** Constants in `.d.ts` are ambient declarations, generated, or runtime-resolved via module augmentation.

**Symptom:** Dead classifier flags const in `.d.ts` as Category C.

**Mitigation:** Exclude `.d.ts` from dead classification by default.

---

## FP-03 — Node `#prefix` subpath imports misclassified as external

**Pattern:** `package.json` `imports` field maps `#alias/*` to internal paths. Default resolver doesn't read `imports`, treats these as npm packages.

**Symptom:** Internal dependencies appear as "external" in topology. Downstream: some exports appear dead because real consumers were hidden.

**Mitigation:** `_lib/alias-map.mjs::buildAliasMap` already handles this. If implementing from scratch, read `pkgJson.imports` and register hash-wildcard mappings.

**Example:** `#web/*` → `./dist/web/*.js` → resolver maps to `./src/web/*.ts`.

---

## FP-04 — React JSX legacy imports

**Pattern:** `.tsx` file with `import React from 'react'` where React is used only by JSX (no explicit `React.X` calls). Legacy JSX transform requires React in scope; new `react-jsx` transform does not.

**Symptom:** Semi-dead imports finder flags React (imported, 0 direct identifier usage).

**Mitigation:** Check `tsconfig.json` `compilerOptions.jsx`:
- `"react"` / `"react-jsxdev"` → React import needed, NOT dead
- `"react-jsx"` → React import IS dead, removable

Emit finding as `[degraded, FP-04]` until tsconfig confirmed.

---

## FP-05 — Pass-through re-export chain

**Pattern:** `A.ts` has `export { X } from './b'`. `C.ts` does `import { X } from './a'`. Resolver links C→A but X's actual definition is in B.

**Symptom:** B's export appears dead even though it has transitive consumers.

**Mitigation:** When building consumer map, follow re-export chains to original definition. Register C as B's consumer, not A's.

---

## FP-06 — Type + predicate partner pattern

**Pattern:** Module exports both `interface Foo` and `function isFoo(x): x is Foo`. External consumers import `isFoo` only; type is inferred via narrowing.

**Symptom:** Type appears in dead Category A (export removable) but predicate is the public API.

**Mitigation:** For each Category A type candidate, check if same file exports `is{Name}`, `assert{Name}`, `parse{Name}`, `to{Name}`, `from{Name}`. If yes, flag as predicate partner — likely intentional.

---

## FP-07 — Test-support helpers outside production scope

**Pattern:** Helpers in `test-support/`, `tests/helpers/`, `__mocks__/` used only by `*.test.ts` files. Dead classifier on production-only scope misses test consumers.

**Symptom:** Test helper flagged as Category C in production-only run.

**Mitigation:** Either scan includes tests, or explicitly separate "production dead" vs "test-support dead" in report. Default: include tests in consumer scan.

---

## FP-08 — Python dynamic method call

**Pattern:** Python is dynamically typed. `obj.method()` cannot be resolved statically without full type inference.

**Symptom:** If attempting Python method call resolution, hit-rate near 0.

**Mitigation:** For Python audits, do NOT claim method call counts. Only identifier-based direct calls. Method-level findings must be `[blind]` with explicit note.

---

## FP-09 — Auto-generated files

**Pattern:** Files from codegen (protobuf, openapi-typescript, graphql-codegen) have mechanical structure with many "unused" exports that are intentionally exhaustive for API surface.

**Symptom:** Dense dead candidates in single file or directory.

**Mitigation:** Exclude glob patterns like `**/__generated__/**`, `**/generated/**`, `**/*.gen.ts`, `**/*.generated.ts` before running dead classifier.

---

## FP-10 — `isolatedModules` type re-export elision

**Pattern:** With `isolatedModules: true`, type-only re-exports require `export type { X }`. Older code using `export { X }` for types may confuse type-aware parsers.

**Symptom:** Type appears as value re-export when it should be type-only.

**Mitigation:** Both forms counted; distinguish in output. Not usually harmful but worth noting.

---

## FP-11 — Discipline scanner self-reference

**Pattern:** `measure-discipline.mjs` stores its own detection patterns as string/regex literals (`/@ts-ignore/g`, `{ name: ':any', ... }`). `emit-sarif.mjs` and comment headers also mention those tokens in prose. When the scanner runs on the grounded-audit repo itself (self-audit / dogfooding), each pattern definition gets counted as an occurrence of the thing it's supposed to detect.

**Symptom:** On self-scan, discipline totals inflate: `:any`, `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, `eslint-disable` all report 3–6 hits despite the skill being pure `.mjs` JavaScript with zero TypeScript. All hits are in `measure-discipline.mjs`, `emit-sarif.mjs` rule descriptions, and header/doc comments.

**Mitigation:** Exclude the skill's own scripts (`measure-discipline.mjs`, `emit-sarif.mjs`, `references/false-positive-patterns.md`) when dogfooding, or label hits in those files as `[degraded, FP-11]`. Do NOT change scanner behavior to ignore its own code — that would mask real patterns if the scanner is embedded in a host project. The FP is specific to self-audit context.

**Example:** 2026-04-18 dogfood of grounded-audit on itself: `:any=5, as any=4, @ts-ignore=6` — all 15 hits verified via grep as self-references in `measure-discipline.mjs` lines 35–38 and `emit-sarif.mjs` line 60.

---

## FP-12 — Top-level `tests/` directory invisible to file walker

**Pattern:** Repos that place tests in a top-level `tests/` directory (not
`src/**/*.test.ts`) are systematically missed by `_lib/collect-files.mjs::collectFiles`.
The legacy canonical-dirs list (`src`, `lib`, `bin`, `types`, `apps`,
`packages`) did not include `tests`.

**Symptom:** Dead-export list inflates with functions imported only by tests.
`symbols.json` reports `deadInTest: 0` regardless of how many test files
actually exist. Production functions that are tested but not used in prod code
are falsely flagged as Category C.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.1+) `collectFiles` now walks `tests`, `test`,
`__tests__`, `e2e`, `integration` by default. Keep `includeTests: false` as
the caller semantic for "filter tests from result", but discovery happens
regardless.

**Example:** 2026-04-18, cli-jaw v1.7.20 audit. `tests/events.test.ts:11`
imports `extractToolLabel`. Scanner walked only 150 files from `src/lib/bin/
types`, missing 145 files in `tests/` → `extractToolLabel` flagged
Category C false-positive.

---

## FP-13 — Repo-root entry files not descended

**Pattern:** `collectFiles` built `searchDirs` only from canonical subdirs.
If any subdir existed, root-level files like `server.ts`, `main.ts`,
`index.ts` (common entry points referenced by `package.json` `main` or
`tsconfig.json` `include`) were not walked.

**Symptom:** Exports consumed only by repo-root entry files look dead.
Common case: HTTP route registration functions (`registerXxxRoutes`)
imported by `server.ts` and called during bootstrap — all flagged as dead
because `server.ts` was invisible.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.1+) After building `searchDirs`, `collectFiles`
additionally enumerates (non-recursively) `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` / `.jsx` /
`.mjs` / `.cjs` files at the repo root.

**Example:** 2026-04-18, cli-jaw v1.7.20 audit. `server.ts` (root, listed in
`tsconfig.include`) imports 11 `register*Routes` from `src/routes/*.ts`.
Not walked → all 11 flagged Category C. ~15% of dead candidates traced to
this single FP.

---

## FP-14 — Frontend asset dirs (`public/`, `app/`, `pages/`) invisible

**Pattern:** Vite / Astro / SvelteKit / Next.js projects store frontend code
in `public/`, `app/`, `pages/`, or `scripts/`. These directories were not in
the default walk list. Exports used only by frontend code appeared dead.

**Symptom:** Shared types (e.g., `HeartbeatJob` consumed by both a
server-side registry and a frontend state module) flagged as dead when
server consumers and frontend consumers are partitioned across walk
boundaries.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.1+) `collectFiles` walks `public`, `app`, `pages`,
`scripts` by default. Future: auto-detect Vite/Astro/Svelte via config
presence and add framework-specific dirs.

**Example:** 2026-04-18, cli-jaw v1.7.20 audit. `public/js/features/heartbeat.ts`
consumes `HeartbeatJob` from server-side types. Not walked → any cross-tier
shared types inflated Category C list in frontend-heavy codebases.

---

## FP-15 — L2 `any-typed` inflated by missing dependencies

**Pattern:** `resolve-method-calls.mjs` reports `BLIND any-typed` as the
dominant bucket (often 50–80% of method calls). User may read this as "the
codebase is chaotic" when the real cause is environmental — `node_modules/`
or specifically `@types/node` isn't installed. Without `@types/node`,
`process.argv` / `fs.readFile` / `path.join` all resolve to `any`, and every
subsequent `.method()` call on them becomes an any-typed blind.

**Symptom:** L2 summary shows high `anyTyped` rate. `resolved-node_modules`
count is 0 or near-zero. `effectiveInternalRate` looks catastrophic despite
the codebase being normal TypeScript.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.1+) `resolve-method-calls.mjs` now emits an
`envDiagnostic` in artifact meta AND prints a ⚠ warning to stderr when
`node_modules/` or `node_modules/@types/node` is missing. Users see the
diagnostic BEFORE the 30s program build. The artifact's `envDiagnostic.epistemicNote`
explicitly labels the L2 result as "unreliable until deps installed" so
downstream reporters can surface the caveat.

**Example (measured 2026-04-18, cli-jaw v1.7.20)**:

| Bucket | Before `npm install` | After `npm install` | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| resolved-internal | 208 (1.8%) | 208 (1.8%) | 0 |
| resolved-lib.d.ts | 3182 (26.8%) | 6345 (53.5%) | +100% (DOM/lib registrations) |
| resolved-node_modules | **0 (0.0%)** | **4595 (38.7%)** | 0 → 38.7% |
| BLIND any-typed | **8418 (70.9%)** | **440 (3.7%)** | −94.8% |
| BLIND unresolved | 58 (0.5%) | 278 (2.3%) | +2% |
| **true blind total** | **71.4%** | **6.1%** | −65.3pp (−91.5%) |
| effective internal rate (non-lib/ext) | 2.4% | 22.5% | +20pp |

Precise validation of the pattern. Diagnostic works. Once `node_modules/` and
`@types/node` are installed, the any-typed collapse is dramatic — roughly
10× reduction in true blind rate. This confirms the diagnostic is the
correct action, not a cop-out.

---

## FP-16 — Root-prefix imports (`from 'src/...'`) treated as EXTERNAL

**Pattern:** Projects that rely on build-time `baseUrl: '.'` resolution
(Claude Code, some Next.js / Vite setups) import internal modules as
`from 'src/bootstrap/state.js'` without matching tsconfig `paths` setup.
Without path info, the resolver's bare-specifier branch returned `EXTERNAL`.

**Symptom:** High unresolved-use rate (>20%). Downstream: symbols imported
this way have zero attributed consumers → flagged as dead. `symbols.json.meta.unresolvedRatio` is elevated; top unresolved specifiers share a
common first segment (`src/...`, `app/...`, `lib/...`).

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.2+) The resolver's bare-specifier branch now attempts
root-prefix resolution: if `spec` starts with a segment that exists as a
directory under `root`, try resolving `<root>/<spec>` with standard
extension / index lookups. If found → valid internal edge; if not → still
returns `EXTERNAL` (legacy behavior preserved for actual npm packages).

**Example (measured 2026-04-18, claudecodesrc/src):** 6,655 unresolved uses
out of 24,137 (27.6%) — 925+ import statements across 301 files. Functions
`markPostCompaction`, `setLastMainRequestId`, `getMeter`, `getLoggerProvider`,
`addToTotalDurationState`, etc. all falsely flagged Class C. With the fix,
most of these resolve correctly to their actual definitions.

---

## FP-17 — Canonical-dirs filter hides non-standard layouts

**Pattern:** Legacy v0.6.1 `collectFiles` built `searchDirs` only from a
hardcoded canonical list (`src`, `lib`, `bin`, `types`, `apps`, `packages`,
tests dirs, frontend dirs). When ONE canonical dir existed under a
target root (e.g., `types/`), the fallback "walk root if no canonical match"
silently disabled. Result: repos with non-canonical subdirs (`client/`,
`server/`, `shared/`, `commands/`, `services/`, `components/`, `assistant/`,
`coordinator/`, …) were catastrophically under-scanned.

**Symptom:** Target reports drastically fewer files than the disk actually
contains. Dead-export list incomplete because most of the codebase wasn't
parsed. No warning emitted — failure is silent.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.2+) `collectFiles` now walks **all non-pruned
top-level subdirs**. Prune list expanded: `node_modules`, `.git`, `coverage`,
`.next`, `.svelte-kit`, `.astro`, `.turbo`, `.cache`, `.nuxt`, `.output`,
`out`, `target`, `venv`, `__pycache__`; plus `dist*`, `build*`, and
dotdirs (except canonical `.` roots). Canonical list kept as "marker set"
for debug but no longer gates scan inclusion.

**Example (measured 2026-04-18, claudecodesrc/src):** Target has 1,884
`.ts/.tsx` files. Pre-fix scanner found **29** (only `types/` + root-level
== 1.5% visibility). Post-fix: 1,902 files scanned (matches disk).

---

## FP-18 — Dynamic `await import(...)` expressions not tracked as edges

**Pattern:** Modern codebases use dynamic `import()` for lazy loading,
code splitting, and plugin systems. These are parsed as `CallExpression`
with `ImportKeyword` callee — NOT `ImportDeclaration`. The AST walker
that builds import edges only looks at `ImportDeclaration` nodes.

**Symptom:** Modules consumed only via `await import('./x.js')` appear
dead. Large chunks of lazy-loaded code (routes, commands, plugins) are
systematically under-counted.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.6+) `build-symbol-graph.mjs:extractDefinitionsAndUses`
gained `collectDynamicImports(node)` which recursively walks the entire
AST (not just `program.body`) and emits a synthetic use record for every
`ImportExpression` whose source is a string literal. The use is tagged
`{ kind: 'dynamic', name: '*', dynamic: true }` and the main consumer loop
treats `kind: 'dynamic'` identically to `kind: 'namespace'` — the target
file enters `namespaceUsers`, its symbols become `namespaceShadowed` and
drop out of `trulyDead`. Non-literal specs are not exactly resolvable.
When a template import has a static directory prefix such as
`` import(`./commands/${name}.js`) ``, the producer emits
`symbols.dynamicImportOpacity[].targetDir`, and
`classify-dead-exports.mjs` materializes exports under that directory as
`MUTED` with `dynamicImportOpacity_FP18` evidence.

**Example (measured 2026-04-19, synthetic repo):** 4-file probe where
`src/target.ts` exports `foo`, `bar`, `Baz`; `src/loader.ts` does
`await import('./target.js')` and `() => import('./target.js')`.
- Pre-fix (v0.6.5): `target.ts`'s 3 symbols all in `trulyDead` (0
  static consumers, dynamic edges invisible).
- Post-fix (v0.6.6): `deadTotal: 7 → trulyDead: 4` — 3 target.ts symbols
  moved to `namespaceShadowed` bucket. `totalUsesResolved: 3` (1 static +
  2 dynamic edges resolved).

Real-repo impact unmeasured on claudecodesrc but prior reading found 207
files in `commands/` using the lazy-loader pattern `load: () => import(...)`;
`components/App.tsx`'s three dynamic consumers (`replLauncher.tsx`,
`dialogLaunchers.tsx`, `ink/ink.tsx`) previously invisible now resolve.

---

## FP-19 — JSX runtime imports (`React`, hooks) flagged semi-dead

**Pattern:** `.tsx` files with `import React from 'react'` and
`import { useCallback, useMemo, useRef } from 'react'` never explicitly
call `React.*` or `useCallback()` directly in the AST — the JSX-runtime
compile step consumes them implicitly (classic-runtime JSX emit) or they're
invoked inside JSX-embedded expressions the extractor doesn't fully walk.

**Symptom:** Call-graph's `semiDeadList` dominated by `React` + hook
imports from React. Real semi-dead cases buried under this noise.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.6+) `build-call-graph.mjs` gained
`REACT_FRAMEWORK_NAMES` set (~27 names: `React`, `Fragment`, all standard
hooks, `forwardRef`/`memo`/`lazy`/`Suspense`, `createContext`, etc.)
plus `isReactRuntimeImport(filePath, localName, source)` predicate.
Filter placed AFTER the `calledNames` / `hits >= 2` checks so
`reactSkipCount` measures TRUE rescues (symbols that would have been
flagged without FP-19), not noise that was never at risk. Applies only
to `.tsx` / `.jsx` files importing from `react`, `react-dom`, or their
subpath exports. Surfaced as `summary.semiDeadReactFiltered: N` in
`call-graph.json` and prose line "(FP-19 React JSX runtime 제외: N)"
in console output.

**Example (2026-04-19, synthetic App.tsx):** File with
`import React from 'react'; import { useState, useCallback, useMemo,
useEffect } from 'react';` plus realistic hook usage inside JSX. Pre-fix
mental model: `React` default flagged (hits=1, only in import line).
Post-fix: `semiDead: 0, semiDeadReactFiltered: 1` — precisely the
`React` default rescued, hooks already resolved via `hits >= 2` text
heuristic. Real-repo impact (claudecodesrc pending): ledger noted 13/15
first entries were React/useCallback noise; with the filter, those
drop out of the output.

---

## FP-20 — Exported type aliases used only intra-file (PERCEPTION FP)

**Pattern:** Components export their `Props` type for potential external
composition: `export type SelectOptionProps = { ... }`. If no other file
imports the type, dead-export detection correctly flags it as having no
external consumer. The classifier puts it in Class A (demote to internal)
since it's used within the defining file.

**Symptom:** Users see 500+ "dead" type aliases in Class A and think the
tool is wrong.

**Mitigation:** This is NOT a code bug — the classifier is correct. Class A
= "export is unnecessary, demote to internal" is the right action, not
"delete". The FP is perceptual: Class A should be framed as "exposure
reduction opportunity", not "dead code". Consider renaming Class A
label in templates/report-template.md to clarify intent.

**Example (2026-04-18, claudecodesrc/src):** 1,310 Class A verdicts
including `QueryEngineConfig`, `SelectOptionProps`, `LogSelectorProps`.
All are exported `type Props = ...` patterns. Demoting them is correct
refactor guidance; deleting them would break the declaring component.

---

## FP-21 — `buildAliasMap` crashes on nested conditional exports

**Pattern:** `package.json.exports` can nest conditions:
`{ ".": { node: { import: { types, default }, require: ... } } }`.
Legacy code did `target.import ?? target.default ?? target.types` and called
`.replace()` on the result — but for the nested shape, `target.import` is
undefined and `target.default` is itself an object, so `.replace` threw
`TypeError: t.replace is not a function`.

**Symptom:** Symbol-graph / classify / call-graph all abort with uncaught
TypeError. Audit pipeline gets blocked on any unjs-style library (consola,
ofetch often do this via unbuild).

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.2+) `_lib/alias-map.mjs::extractStringTarget` —
recursive helper walks `import → default → node → require → types` keys,
unwrapping nested objects and arrays until it finds a string. Handles all
ESM/CJS/Node subpath-export conditional shapes in practice.

**Example (2026-04-18, unjs/consola):** `package.json.exports['.']` is
`{ node: { import: {...}, require: {...} } }`. Pre-fix: pipeline crashed
at first symbol-graph invocation. Post-fix: resolves cleanly to the
string target.

---

## FP-22 — Config files flagged Class C "completely dead"

**Pattern:** Build/tooling config files (`*.config.ts`, `eslint.config.mjs`,
`vitest.config.ts`, `build.config.ts`, etc.) are consumed by CLI tools
(eslint, vitest, vite, webpack, rollup, unbuild, tsup, esbuild, jest,
playwright, tailwind, postcss) **by filename convention**, not via TS
import. They appear to have zero consumers in the symbol graph.

**Symptom:** Class C (completely dead) inflated by config file exports.
On ofetch: 2/2 Class C entries were eslint + vitest configs. On consola:
2/4 Class C were eslint + build configs. Precision on Class C drops below
50% on small popular libraries — the tool shows more noise than signal.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.3+) `classify-dead-exports.mjs` masks ~18 well-known
config filename patterns BEFORE classification. Masked count surfaced in
output as `[FP-22 excluded] config files: N`.

**Example (2026-04-18):**
- ofetch: 2 eslint + vitest configs excluded → C: 2 → 0 (100% reduction).
- consola: 2 eslint + build configs excluded → C: 4 → 2 (50% reduction).

---

## FP-23 — Package public-API terminals flagged Class A "demote"

**Pattern:** A file that is the terminal target of a
`package.json.exports` chain IS the package's public API. External
consumers (other npm packages depending on this library) import from
it — those imports are outside the scanned set, so symbol-graph counts
zero consumers, and classifier demotes to Class A ("remove export").

**Symptom:** Library `src/index.ts` etc. entries repeatedly flagged Class A.
Developer removes `export`, breaks every external consumer. Catastrophic
guidance.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.3+) `classify-dead-exports.mjs` consults
`buildAliasMap()` from resolver; files that appear as `exact.path` in any
alias entry are flagged as public-API terminals and EXCLUDED from
classification entirely. Surfaced as `[FP-23 excluded] public API: N`.

**Example (2026-04-18):** ofetch's 3 Class A entries (`ofetch`,
`createConsola`, default from `src/index.ts`) all are `package.json.exports['.']`
targets. Excluded post-fix. consola: 5/11 Class A entries similarly excluded.

---

## FP-24 — Cross-file imports within `examples/` under-resolved

**Pattern:** `examples/basic.ts` imports `{ reporterDemo } from "./utils"`
(consola). `examples/utils/index.ts` exports `reporterDemo`. Symbol-graph
walks both files (after FP-14 fix) but counts `reporterDemo`'s internal
use as 0. Classifier flags it Class C "completely dead, 0 internal uses".

**Symptom:** Cross-file relative imports within `examples/` subtree appear
unresolved even when the target file IS scanned. Might indicate path
normalization issue or that examples/ is tagged as a separate partition
and its edges aren't attributed.

**Mitigation:** (investigate, not yet fixed) Needs tracing: verify
`resolveSpecifier` from build-symbol-graph.mjs correctly resolves relative
imports when both fromFile and target are under `examples/`. Possible
root cause: my FP-16 "root-prefix" heuristic may short-circuit relative
resolution under certain conditions.

**Example (2026-04-18, unjs/consola):** `examples/basic.ts:??` has
`import { reporterDemo } from "./utils"`. `examples/utils/index.ts:4`
exports `reporterDemo`. Flagged Class C despite being imported.

---

## FP-25 — Transitive barrel re-export chains hide consumers

**Pattern:** Monorepos with deep barrel-file chains (`packages/foo/src/index.ts`
→ `packages/foo/src/api/index.ts` → `packages/foo/src/api/v4.ts` →
`packages/foo/src/api/v4/schemas.ts`) expose public APIs through layered
re-exports. The symbol graph's direct-consumer map misses symbols that
are only reached via the chain: `schemas.ts` exports a function → barrel
at each level just re-exports → external package `packages/bar/src/foo.ts`
imports from the topmost barrel. Classifier sees "only consumed by barrels"
and labels Class A (demote) or even C (dead).

**Symptom:** Large monorepos show inflated Class A numbers concentrated in
leaf files of deep barrel trees. Typical zod/unjs layout:
`packages/<pkg>/src/<module>/<sub>/<file>.ts` where the "consumer" column
lists only sibling `index.ts` barrels.

**Mitigation:** `build-symbol-graph.mjs` and audit-core resolve re-export chains
per export identity. Named re-exports add exact identity fan-in; star and broad
namespace consumers remain broad graph evidence. `classify-dead-exports.mjs`
protects direct package entry files but does not promote transitive target
files wholesale. This keeps the public identity protected while allowing dead
sibling exports in the same source module to remain candidates.

**Regression contract:** a package entry that names one export from each of 20
modules protects those 20 identities while all 60 unrelated sibling exports
remain review-visible. File-level transitive protection would incorrectly mute
all 60 as `publicApi_FP23`.

---

## FP-26 — pnpm monorepo with `pnpm-workspace.yaml` invisible to `detectRepoMode`

**Pattern:** pnpm declares its workspace roots in a separate
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` file, not in `package.json.workspaces`. Legacy
`detectRepoMode` read only `pkgJson.workspaces` → any pnpm monorepo was
silently classified as `single-package`. Downstream, `buildAliasMap` built
no cross-package aliases, and cross-package imports (`import { z } from
"zod/v4"`) were treated as EXTERNAL npm packages.

**Symptom:** `meta.repoMode === "single-package"` on a clearly multi-package
repo. `workspaceDirs.length === 0`. `aliasMap` size 0 or near-zero despite
rich `package.json.exports` fields in each subpackage. Inter-package symbol
traffic invisible → the entire monorepo's public API surface flagged
Class A / Class C in bulk.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.5+) `_lib/repo-mode.mjs` gains
`parsePnpmWorkspaceYaml(yamlText)`: minimal indent-aware parser matching
the `packages:` list convention (`packages:\n  - 'packages/*'\n  -
'!packages/deprecated'`). `detectRepoMode` first checks
`package.json.workspaces`, then falls back to reading
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Negated patterns (`!...`) are skipped as exclusions
(consistent with pnpm semantics — they still aren't walked, matching
pnpm's own behavior of excluding negated globs from workspace resolution).

**Example (2026-04-18, colinhacks/zod v3):**

| Field | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `detectRepoMode` | `single-package` | `monorepo` |
| `workspaceDirs.length` | 0 | 7 |
| `aliasMap` entries | 0 | 12 |
| cross-package import resolution | EXTERNAL for all | resolved for all 7 |

---

## FP-27 — Framework sentinel files (`app/page.tsx`, `+page.svelte`) flagged dead

**Pattern:** Next.js App Router (`app/page.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`,
`app/loading.tsx`, `app/error.tsx`, `app/route.ts`, etc.), Pages Router
(`pages/foo.tsx`, `pages/api/bar.ts`), SvelteKit (`+page.svelte`,
`+layout.ts`, `+page.server.ts`), and similar conventions rely on
**filename-based file-system routing**. These files are never explicitly
imported by user code; the framework runtime discovers and mounts them by
path. Symbol graph sees 0 consumers → classifier places them in Class C
"completely dead".

**Symptom:** Docs-site packages, example-app packages, or any
`packages/*/app/**` or `packages/*/pages/**` tree in a monorepo shows
dense Class C findings. Typical volume: 20–40 entries per framework-aware
package.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.5+) `classify-dead-exports.mjs` gains
`isFrameworkSentinel(relPath)`:
- `pages/**` anywhere in path → sentinel.
- `app/**` with basename stem in `FRAMEWORK_SENTINEL_BASENAMES`
  (`page`, `layout`, `loading`, `error`, `not-found`, `route`, `default`,
  `template`, `global-error`, `sitemap`, `robots`, `manifest`, `icon`,
  `apple-icon`, `opengraph-image`, `twitter-image`, `head`) → sentinel.
- SvelteKit `+<stem>.(svelte|ts|tsx|js)` at any depth → sentinel.
- Astro endpoint convention `+<name>.ts` → sentinel.

Regex `(?:^|\/)app\/` (not `^(?:[^/]+\/)?app\/`) so that `packages/docs/
app/page.tsx` and similar nested paths in monorepos still match. Sentinel
files are EXCLUDED from Class C classification; surfaced as `[FP-27
excluded] framework sentinels: N`.

**Example (2026-04-18, colinhacks/zod v3):** `packages/docs/app/**`
contained 23 Next.js App Router sentinel files (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`,
`loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx` across ~6 routes). Pre-fix: all 23 in
Class C. Post-fix: 23 excluded, `excludedMeta.frameworkSentinels: 23`.
Class C dropped from 77 → 52.

## FP-28 — Custom `@source` conditional exports bypassed in favor of compiled `import`

**Pattern:** A library that ships both source and compiled output can
declare a custom source-pointing condition in `package.json.exports`:
```json
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "@zod/source": "./src/index.ts",
    "import": "./index.js",
    "types": "./index.d.ts"
  }
}
```
Legacy `extractStringTarget` preferred `import → default → node → require
→ types` (compiled-output priority). It returned `./index.js` (compiled
JS dist) even when the audit tool needs the source `./src/index.ts` for
AST parsing / consumer attribution.

**Symptom:** For repos with `@<pkg>/source`-style conditions, alias-map
targets point at compiled `dist/*.js` files. Dead-export classifier
attributes cross-package consumer edges to dist files, which it can't
parse. Effect: the entire monorepo's inter-package consumer graph is
silently disconnected — most Class A / Class C verdicts in the mono-repo
are noise.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.5+) `extractStringTarget` checks condition keys for
source-indicating substrings FIRST: any key containing `source`, `src`,
`development`, or `develop` gets preference ahead of the standard
`import/default/...` list. Falls back to the standard order for ordinary
exports. Preserves compatibility (no source-condition = same behavior as
before).

**Example (2026-04-18, colinhacks/zod v3):** `packages/zod/package.json`
uses `@zod/source: "./src/index.ts"` alongside `import: "./index.js"`.
Pre-fix: alias-map target = `packages/zod/index.js` (non-existent at
scan time; dist files aren't emitted in a fresh clone). Post-fix: target
= `packages/zod/src/index.ts`, resolver successfully maps imports from
`packages/zod-mini` / `packages/docs` to actual source definitions.
This single fix is upstream of FP-25's effective impact — without the
`@zod/source` preference, the transitive barrel walk would chase
phantom dist files.

## FP-29 — pnpm `packages/**` and negated patterns ignored by workspace expander

**Pattern:** pnpm-workspace.yaml routinely uses:
```yaml
packages:
  - docs
  - packages/**
  - '!packages/deprecated'
  - playground
  - test/fixtures/*
```
Legacy `detectRepoMode` (v0.6.5) handled only `/*` (single-star, immediate
children) and literal names. `packages/**` (recursive) fell into the
"literal" branch and was treated as a directory named `packages/**` —
which doesn't exist, so silently skipped. Negated patterns (`!foo`) were
stripped by `parsePnpmWorkspaceYaml` without being applied as exclusions.

**Symptom:** On pnpm monorepos using `packages/**` convention (nuxt,
many unjs repos, most modern ecosystem packages), `workspaceDirs` is
drastically incomplete — only `docs`, `playground`, literal-name dirs,
and `/*`-matched test fixtures populate. `aliasMap` contains only the
workspaces that DO get detected (often a single `@org/docs/*`), and
cross-package imports for the missing packages are treated as EXTERNAL.
Cascade: `unresolvedRatio > 70%`, dead-export list inflated with
cross-package-consumed symbols. Silent — no warning.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.7+) `detectRepoMode` partitions patterns into
includes vs excludes, expands with three branches:
- `foo/**` → recursive walk via `walkForPkgs(foo)`, collect every subdir
  (any depth, excluding `node_modules` and dotdirs) that has a
  `package.json`.
- `foo/*` → immediate children only (legacy behavior preserved).
- `foo` → literal path.
Then applies exclusions: any collected dir whose absolute path exactly
matches or is prefixed by a negated pattern is filtered out.
`parsePnpmWorkspaceYaml` now preserves `!`-prefixed patterns
(previously stripped) so the exclusion phase sees them.

**Example (2026-04-19, nuxt/nuxt):**

| Measure | v0.6.6 | v0.6.7 | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `workspaceDirs` | 12 | 20 | +67% (+8 real packages) |
| `aliasMap` entries | 1 | 29 | 29× |
| unresolved-ratio | 71% | 60% | −11pp |
| dead prod candidates | 386 | 376 | −2.6% (initial) |
| negation patterns applied | 0 | 2 (`!packages/nuxi`, `!packages/test-utils`) | ✓ |

## FP-30 — Nitro / Nuxt framework-internal runtime auto-registered files

**Pattern:** Nuxt 3 and Nitro use filesystem-convention routing for
runtime artifacts that the framework itself discovers and registers at
build/start time. Inside the Nuxt monorepo itself, this translates to:
- `packages/nitro-server/src/runtime/handlers/*.ts` — h3 event handlers
- `packages/nitro-server/src/runtime/middleware/*.ts` — Nitro middleware
- `packages/nitro-server/src/runtime/plugins/*.ts` — Nitro plugins
- `packages/nitro-server/src/runtime/utils/*.ts` — shared runtime helpers
- `packages/nuxt/src/app/plugins/*.ts` — built-in Nuxt plugins
- `packages/nuxt/src/app/middleware/*.ts` — built-in Nuxt middleware
- `packages/nuxt/src/app/entry.ts`, `entry-spa.ts` — framework entry points

In user-level Nuxt apps, the same convention applies at project root:
- `plugins/*.ts`, `middleware/*.ts`, `server/api/**`, `server/middleware/**`,
  `server/plugins/**`, `server/routes/**`, `composables/**`, `components/**`

None of these are explicitly imported by user code; the framework's
virtual-module system (`#imports`, `#app`, `#nitro`) wires them.

**Symptom:** Nuxt audit shows ~43 Class C entries matching these
conventions — all `export default` shapes that are zero-consumer by
static analysis but framework-registered.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.8+) `classify-dead-exports.mjs` gained
`detectNuxtNitro(rootPkgJson, workspaceDirs)` which scans root + all
workspace `package.json` files for matching deps/devDeps/peerDeps
(`nuxt`, `nitropack`, `nitro`, `h3`, `@nuxt/*`, `@nitro/*`) or a matching
`name` field. Gate result (`isNuxtNitro: boolean`) unlocks
`isNuxtNitroSentinel(relPath)` which matches:
- `**/server/(api|middleware|plugins|routes)/**` — h3 convention
- `**/runtime/(handlers|middleware|plugins|utils|server-assets)/**`
- `**/app/(plugins|middleware)/**` + `**/app/entry(-spa)?.*`
- `**/(plugins|middleware|composables)/*` one level deep (user-app
  convention)
- `**/components/runtime/**`

`excludedNuxtNitro` counter surfaced in summary.excluded.nuxtNitro_FP30
+ console line "[FP-30 excluded] Nuxt/Nitro filesystem-routed files".
Falls back to no-op when detection fails — zero overmatch risk outside
Nuxt/Nitro ecosystem.

**Example (2026-04-19, nuxt/nuxt):**

| Stage | v0.6.7 | v0.6.8 | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Classifier total | 154 | 72 | −53% |
| Class C | 53 | 15 | −72% |
| Class A | 78 | 37 | −53% |
| Class B | 23 | 20 | −13% |
| FP-30 excluded | 0 | 82 | (new) |

Combined with FP-22/23/27/31: 137 sentinels total excluded on nuxt
(14+32+9+82), vs. 0 pre-v0.6.3. Grounded-audit's own self-audit
unaffected (no Nuxt/Nitro deps → gate returns false).

## FP-31 — Test fixture directories inflate production dead list

**Pattern:** Monorepos often include fixture packages (`test/fixtures/*`,
`packages/*/test/layer-fixture/**`, `packages/*/test/components-fixture/**`)
that are valid pnpm workspaces (have `package.json`) and intentionally
contain minimal code exercising specific framework behaviors. Files
inside these directories define exports that are "consumed" only via
being loaded by the test harness under a specific framework-runtime
scenario — invisible to static analysis.

Legacy test-path filter in `build-symbol-graph.mjs` caught only
`.test.<ext>` suffix and `/test-support/` path. Missed:
- Package-internal `test/` subdirectories
- `*-fixture/` convention dirs (`components-fixture/`, `layer-fixture/`,
  `layers-fixture/`, `package-fixture/`)
- Workspace-level `test/fixtures/*` packages (activated by FP-29 fix)
- `/fixtures/` dir name generally

**Symptom:** Dead production list contains 30–50% fixture-code entries
after FP-29 expands workspace discovery. User sees "N fixtures flagged"
and loses trust in the tool. On nuxt: 115/292 = 39% of classifier
findings were fixtures.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.7+ / extended v0.6.8) `build-symbol-graph.mjs:isTestPath(f)`
checks path segments. Initial set: `test`, `tests`, `test-support`,
`fixtures`, `mocks`, plus any segment ending in `-fixture` / `-fixtures`.
v0.6.8 extensions surfaced by vite audit:
- `playground` / `playgrounds` — strong dev-test convention in
  Vite/unjs/Rspress/Astro ecosystems.
- `__<anything>__` generalized (any double-underscore-wrapped segment) —
  catches `__tests__`, `__mocks__`, `__snapshots__`, `__fixtures__`,
  `__tests_dts__` (vite-specific type-test fixtures), and similar.
Applied via `deadInTest` filter before classification.

**Example (2026-04-19, nuxt/nuxt):**

| Stage | Pre-FP-31 | Post-FP-31 | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deadInProd (from symbols.json) | 376 | 209 | −44% |
| Classifier total | 292 | 154 | −47% |
| Class C | 184 | 53 | −71% |
| Class A | 85 | 78 | −8% |
| Class B | 23 | 23 | 0 |

**Example (2026-04-19, vitejs/vite):** Vite's `playground/` is a workspace
of ~50 test playgrounds (react, vue, alias, css, ssr, etc.). Before
extension: 322/387 (83%) of classified findings were playground fixtures.

| Stage | Pre-v0.6.8 FP-31 | Post-v0.6.8 FP-31 | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deadInProd | 574 | 151 | −74% |
| Classifier total | 387 | 60 | −85% |
| Class C | 261 | 15 | −94% |

## FP-33 — `package.json` with UTF-8 BOM crashes JSON parsing

**Pattern:** Windows-edited `package.json` files occasionally ship with a
UTF-8 BOM (`0xEF 0xBB 0xBF` / `\uFEFF` prefix). `JSON.parse()` in Node.js
does NOT strip BOM — it throws `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '﻿'`.
Several of our scripts read external `package.json` files (resolver.mjs
for workspace detection, build-symbol-graph for barrel detection,
classify-dead-exports for Nuxt/Nitro detection, triage-repo for overview).

**Symptom:** Audit pipeline aborts with uncaught SyntaxError on the first
BOM-prefixed package.json. Surface error message points at the JSON
parser, not the offending file. Reproduces on any monorepo where a
workspace member has a BOM-prefixed package.json — not controllable by
the audit tool. On vitejs/vite, one of the create-vite templates
ships with BOM.

**Mitigation:** (v0.6.8+) All external-JSON-read sites use
`JSON.parse(readFileSync(p, 'utf8').replace(/^\uFEFF/, ''))`. Our own
artifact reads (symbols.json, cache files) aren't affected (we emit
without BOM), so only external-data readers were patched. Sites fixed:
- `_lib/repo-mode.mjs` (root pkg — `detectRepoMode`)
- `_lib/alias-map.mjs` (workspace pkg in `buildAliasMap`)
- `build-symbol-graph.mjs:455` (barrel-file package.json)
- `classify-dead-exports.mjs:99` (Nuxt/Nitro detection)
- `triage-repo.mjs:41` (repo overview)

**Example (2026-04-19, vitejs/vite):** Pipeline crashed at
`buildAliasMap`. Trace: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '﻿', "﻿{ \"name\"..."`.
Post-fix: full audit completes in one shot (1,418 files parsed).

## FP-36 — Monorepo-local tsconfig `paths` ignored (scope-unaware resolver)

**Pattern:** In multi-app monorepos, each app/package often defines its
own `tsconfig.json` with a local paths alias such as:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": { "@/*": ["./*"] }
  }
}
```

Inside `apps/agents`, `@/components/auth-control` must resolve to
`apps/agents/components/auth-control.tsx`. Inside `apps/admin`, the
same specifier must resolve to `apps/admin/components/auth-control.tsx`.

Before v1.9.7, the resolver had no `tsconfig paths` support at all —
it only read `package.json` exports/imports + root-prefix fallbacks.
Every `@/*` specifier fell through to the `EXTERNAL` sentinel, which
at the call site collapsed to `null` and inflated `unresolvedUses`.
Consequence: exports with real internal consumers appeared consumer-less
and got classified as Tier C "dead export."

**Symptom:** Elevated Tier C count on any monorepo using per-app path
aliases. Observed on duyet/monorepo (2026-04): 218 of 397 Tier C
findings were actually consumed via app-local `@/*` aliases. 73.2%
FP rate driven by this single resolver blind spot. The same audit on
single-app repos (e.g., cli-jaw) showed a healthy ~22% effective
rate — the bug hid on flat repos and only manifested in multi-tsconfig
trees.

**Critical design note:** `@/*` is NOT a global alias. It is a
**per-fromFile local alias**. A flat alias map of the form

```
@/* → apps/agents/*
@/* → apps/admin/*
```

cannot work: whichever entry is inserted last wins globally, and the
resolver returns the wrong file for at least one app. The resolver
must be **scope-aware** — for each importing file, apply the nearest
applicable tsconfig whose scope directory contains the importer.

**Mitigation (v1.9.7):**

1. New module `_lib/tsconfig-paths.mjs` walks the repo and records
   every `compilerOptions.paths` entry with its scope directory
   (directory of the owning tsconfig.json) and `baseUrl`. Handles
   `extends` chains and JSON-with-comments.
2. `_lib/alias-map.mjs` attaches the flat array as
   `aliasMap.scopedTsconfigPaths`.
3. `_lib/resolver-core.mjs` consumes it BEFORE `package.json`
   exports lookup. Filters to entries whose `scopeDir` contains
   `fromFile`, sorts nearest-scope-first then longest-prefix-first,
   tries each matching target in order.
4. New sentinel `UNRESOLVED_INTERNAL` distinguishes "local alias
   matched but target file missing" (scanner blind spot) from
   `EXTERNAL` (legitimate npm package).
5. `build-symbol-graph` splits `unresolvedUses` into three counters:
   `uses.resolvedInternal` / `uses.external` / `uses.unresolvedInternal`.
   External packages no longer inflate the resolver-blindness ratio.
6. `symbols.json` emits `topUnresolvedSpecifiers[]` with prefix,
   count, example, and `likelyCause` heuristic — when the prefix
   matches `@/`, `~/`, `#/`, or a `@scope/` pattern, we tell the user
   "check per-app tsconfig.json" explicitly.
7. `rank-fixes` and `emit-sarif` now gate on `unresolvedInternalRatio`,
   not the legacy conflated total.

**Evidence:** `tests/test-tsconfig-paths-scoped.mjs` verifies the
invariant with a two-app fixture. T3 (same specifier, different
importers, different target files) is the structural guard — a flat
alias map cannot satisfy it. Empirically verified that reverting the
scoped-paths block makes T1–T4 and T6 all fail (5 of 7 assertions).

**Iron Law implication:** Tier C is raw evidence, not a claim.

```
Tier C = no consumer found in the constructed graph
       ≠ unused / truly dead
```

When `unresolvedInternalRatio` is high or top unresolved prefixes
match local alias conventions, Claude must downgrade the claim
rather than treat Tier C as truth. v1.9.5's ranking layer gates
on this via SAFE_FIX → DEGRADED demotion; Claude's review layer
should do the same when reading fix-plan.json.

31. Are test fixture directories (`fixtures/`, `*-fixture/`, `test/`, `playground/`, `__*__`) showing as production dead? → FP-31
32. Does the audit crash with `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '﻿'` on a package.json? → FP-33 (BOM)
33. Is this a multi-app monorepo where each `apps/*` has its own `tsconfig.json` with `paths: { "@/*": [...] }`? → FP-36 (scope-unaware resolver)

If any matches: add `false_positive_flag: true` and `fp_ledger_refs: [FP-NN]` to the finding, and emit `[degraded]` or exclude entirely depending on severity.
